# Activism Framework

A collaboratively developed framework for planning activist campaigns, started at MozFest 2015. This project aims to provide a shared resource for anyone approaching the task of planning a new activist campaign. 

__Share your experiences and views of campaigning by opening a pull request or creating an issue on this repository - all contributions welcome!__

Elements to think about when planning a campaign:
* [defining the issue](issue.md)
* goals
* [decision-making](decision-making.md)
* [people / stakeholders](people.md)
  * identifying roles (activists, partners, allies, targets, leadership)
* advocacy
* education
* legitimacy
* scaleability
* [organization](Organization.md)
* timeline
* experiences / rationale
* resources
  * does a framework already exist?
  * good practice - what's worked already?
* outcomes
* tactics
  * media
    * identifying social media platforms
  * offline activities
  * identifying audiences
  * call to action
